# COLLEGE_ENQUIRY_CHATBOT

ABSTRACT

  
Today, many people are using smartphones with many new applications, i.e., technology is growing day by day. Today, artificial intelligence is playing a major role in a variety of fields, ranging from industries in product manufacturing to customer care in public relations. As there are many online artificial intelligence (AI) systems or chat bots that exist and help people solve their problems, this will work as a college-oriented intelligence machine. This virtual machine will respond to the queries of students on college-related issues. A chatbot has information stored in its database to identify the sentences and make a decision itself as a response to answer  a given question. The college inquiry chat bot will be built to analyse queries and understand the userâ€™s message.

 PROPOSED SOLUTION
    
    
To address this problem, we propose the development of a college enquiry chatbot that can automate the process of answering frequently asked questions related to admissions, courses, fees, schedules, and other information. The chatbot will use natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries in real-time, 24/7. This will reduce the workload of college administration offices, improve response times, and provide students and parents with instant access to information. Moreover, the chatbot will be designed to offer a personalized experience by understanding the needs and preferences of individual users.The development of a college enquiry chatbot has the potential to significantly improve the user experience for students and parents, reduce the workload of college administration offices, and increase efficiency in the admission process. However, the development of such a chatbot requires careful consideration of user needs, effective integration with existing college systems, and ongoing maintenance and updates to ensure accuracy and relevance.

METHODOLOGY
               
Identify the requirements and objectives for the chatbot, such as the type of information it should provide, the platforms it should support, the expected response time, etc. Then,  Collect the data required for the chatbot such as frequently asked questions, course details, admission procedures, fees structure, etc. from the college website, brochure, or from the college administration. Choose a suitable chatbot platform like Dialogflow, IBM Watson, or Microsoft Bot Framework, Pytorch Framework. Decide on the chatbot flow, such as the welcome message, response messages, and follow-up questions based on the user input. Use the chosen platform to create the chatbot by configuring the intents, entities, and responses. Train the chatbot with the collected .Integrate the chatbot with the college website or social media platforms like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Telegram to make it accessible to users. Test the chatbot thoroughly for any bugs, inconsistencies, or errors. Get feedback from users and make any necessary changes to improve the chatbot's performance. Once the chatbot is tested and working correctly, deploy it to the production environment. Monitor the chatbot's performance regularly, update it with new information, and make changes as necessary to keep it up to date.
